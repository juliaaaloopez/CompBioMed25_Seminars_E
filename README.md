In this project, we used electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for the purpose of studying where the various types of ventricular arrythmias (VAs) originated, particularly the areas called outflow tracts of the heart which represents somewhat a sensitive spot starting the Outflow Tract Ventricular Arrhythmias (OTVAs). These arrhythmias can originate from the right or left side of the heart (RVOT or LVOT) and cause premature ventricular contractions (PVC). Distinguishing between them is important, so clinicians can proceed with the ablation of the origin of the VA.
